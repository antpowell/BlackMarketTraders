         p We view the social, economic, and financial and systems as an integrated set of complex dynamical systems that produce the goods and services of society and the measurements of those products and services. Those measurements are the thousands of time series collected by governments, businesses, and institutions around the world. At last count there are over 421000 time series available from the FRED Economic Data site operated by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Other time series are produced by the Census Bureau and many other department of the government.
         p Dynamical systems are usually described by systems of differential equations. However, no one knows how these system looks or even that they exist within the usual meanings of our science of dynamical systems. Dynamkt.com mines these data for correlations that fit the assumption and seeks to describe the dynamical systems that originate the data. This presents both an inverse problem of differential equations and a system’s identification problem for dynamical systems.
         p The approach here is computational and this website presents a realization of this work in three selected futures markets, currencies, indices, and metals.

            h1 Philosophy
         p In financial markets the conventional wisdom is that you must “buy low and sell high.” At least, that what the old traders told me when I first began studying the markets back in the 1960s. The catch is that they never said how you do it. They probably did not know, at least in the terms that I will discuss in this little essay.
         p Trading futures is a zero sum game. A zero-sum game is between two players where whatever one player wins, the other must lose.  Most popular zero sum games are two person games; beginning with the children’s game Tic-Tac-Toe, on to checkers, and to chess, which is an exceptionally complicated two-person zero-sum game, because of the games architecture, where the number of possible moves together with the sequence of those moves is astronomical. IBM is making an industry from its apparent solution of the chess problem with Watson, it super sophisticated program to play chess with a computer. That it is possible to do this has been known to computer scientists and mathematicians for a very long time. IBM had the resources and the political will to do it! Congratulate them.
         p Trading on the futures markets is an enormous zero-sum game that has evolved aninfrastructure that facilitates fully electronic operations. There are two player populations called “the Bulls” and “the Bears” in the traditional view of the financial markets. The Bulls believe that the trading instrument is going up in value and the Bears believe that it is going down. Many people believe that the analysis of financial charts provides the information as to whether the particular market is going up or down. Financial charts are a very old technology that has not worked very well historically. p In this twenty-first century everything is being automated. Driverless cars will soon be a reality as well as pilotless commercial airplanes. Smart houses with smart appliances and all manner of intelligent products will be available as the internet of things and automation become a part of everyday life.
         p Dynamkt.com presents an automated fund manager for the financial markets. If you cantrust you life to an autonomous airplane, then you can surely trust your financial life to an autonomous financial manager that and determine up from down like an autonomous airplane and with astounding results.
         p In the era of “big data” that is available to everyone, it should be no surprise that such anautonomous financial manager is possible. The financial infrastructure of markets has coalesced in to a few highly automated companies that operate the financial exchanges. The trading public has to have a higher technology that is much more effective in trading these markets. Dynamkt.com will publish the results of its analyses of the markets on a daily basis and you can judge for yourselves the effectiveness of the analytics.
